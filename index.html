			<h1>Hi there, I'm Jesus Water Truck!</h1>
			<p>I'm a box truck that drives around Baltimore giving out <em>free water and free listening</em>. I'm just an idea at this point. <a href="/about">Why should I exist?</a></p>
			<p>This is also an example of what a super-simple site (hosted for free on Github) can look like. <a href="https://kingha.us">Here's who made it.</a></p>
